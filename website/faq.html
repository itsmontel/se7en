                        SE7EN is a credit-based accountability app that helps you reduce screen time addiction. You start each week with 7 credits. Stay within your daily app usage limits to keep your credits. Exceed your limits and lose credits. At the end of each week, you pay $0.99 for each credit lost. This financial accountability helps you stay disciplined with your screen time goals.

                        You receive 7 credits at the start of each week when you subscribe. Each day, you set time limits for specific apps (like Instagram, TikTok, etc.). If you stay within your limits for the day, you keep your credit. If you exceed the limit, you lose one credit for that day. At the end of the week, you're charged $0.99 for each lost credit, and your credits reset to 7 for the next week.

                        Why does SE7EN cost money?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        SE7EN uses financial accountability as a psychological tool. Research shows that loss aversion (the fear of losing money) is a powerful motivator for behavior change. When there's a real cost to exceeding your limits, you're much more likely to stick to your goals. The base $7/week subscription grants you 7 credits, and you only pay extra ($0.99 per credit) if you break your commitments.

                        SE7EN has a base subscription of $7.00 per week, which includes access to all features and 7 credits. Additionally, you'll be charged $0.99 for each credit you lose during the week. For example, if you lose 2 credits in a week, your total charge would be $7.00 (subscription) + $1.98 (2 lost credits) = $8.98 for that week.

                        SE7EN uses Apple's official Screen Time API, which is the same technology that powers iOS's built-in Screen Time feature. It's highly accurate and tracks actual app usage time. The tracking runs in the background and doesn't require any manual input from you.

                        Yes! You can adjust your daily limits at any time in the Goals section. However, changes only apply to future days - you can't retroactively change a limit to avoid losing a credit for the current day. This maintains the integrity of the accountability system.

                        No, SE7EN does not block or restrict access to your apps. It's an accountability tool, not a blocking tool. You'll receive notifications when you're approaching your limits and when you exceed them, but you maintain full control. The accountability comes from the financial consequence of losing credits, not from forced restrictions.
