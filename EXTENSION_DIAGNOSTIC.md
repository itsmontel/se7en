# DeviceActivityReport Extension Diagnostic

## 🔍 ADDED COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING

I've added detailed logging to track EXACTLY what's happening in the report extension:

### **New Logs You'll See:**

#### **1. Extension Initialization:**
```
🎬 SE7ENDeviceActivityReportExtension: INITIALIZED
🏗️ SE7ENDeviceActivityReportExtension: Building scenes...
```
- If you DON'T see these → Extension not loading at all

#### **2. Extension Invocation:**
```
🚀 TodayOverviewReport.makeConfiguration: EXTENSION INVOKED!
```
- If you see this → Extension IS running
- If you DON'T see this → Extension not being called

#### **3. Data Processing:**
```
📦 Processing deviceActivityData...
📈 Segment 1: duration=120s
   📂 Category 1
      📱 App 1: Instagram = 60s
      📱 App 2: Safari = 60s
```
- Shows exactly what data the extension receives

#### **4. Final Summary:**
```
📊 TodayOverviewReport SUMMARY:
   Segments: 2, Categories: 1, Apps: 5
   totalDuration: 300s
   uniqueApps: 5
   perAppDuration: 5 entries
```

#### **5. No Data Case:**
```
⚠️ TodayOverviewReport: NO USAGE DATA - Returning .empty
```
- Extension ran but got zero data from system

## 🧪 TESTING PROCEDURE

### **Step 1: Rebuild & Install**
1. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build (Cmd+B)
3. Run on device (Cmd+R)
4. **Verify app installs completely**

### **Step 2: Check Console Filter**
1. In Xcode console, click the filter dropdown
2. **Select "All Processes"** (not just "Seven")
3. This ensures you see extension logs

### **Step 3: Use Apps**
1. Close SE7EN completely
2. Use Instagram/Safari/YouTube for 2-3 minutes
3. **Important**: Actually interact with the apps, don't just open them

### **Step 4: Reopen SE7EN**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after using apps
2. Reopen SE7EN
3. **Watch console carefully**

## 🎯 WHAT THE LOGS WILL TELL US

### **Scenario 1: No Extension Logs At All**
```
(No 🎬, 🏗️, or 🚀 logs)
```
**Problem**: Extension not installed or not running
**Fix**: 
- Check if extension target is in scheme
- Verify signing/provisioning
- Reinstall app completely

### **Scenario 2: Extension Initialized But Never Invoked**
```
🎬 SE7ENDeviceActivityReportExtension: INITIALIZED
🏗️ SE7ENDeviceActivityReportExtension: Building scenes...
(But no 🚀 TodayOverviewReport.makeConfiguration log)
```
**Problem**: Extension loaded but DeviceActivityReport view not triggering it
**Possible causes**:
- Authorization not fully approved
- DeviceActivityReport view not visible in UI
- Filter scope mismatch

### **Scenario 3: Extension Invoked But No Data**
```
🚀 TodayOverviewReport.makeConfiguration: EXTENSION INVOKED!
📊 TodayOverviewReport SUMMARY:
   Segments: 0, Categories: 0, Apps: 0
   totalDuration: 0s
⚠️ TodayOverviewReport: NO USAGE DATA - Returning .empty
```
**Problem**: Extension works but system provides no data
**Possible causes**:
- Apps used aren't in monitored categories
- Monitoring sessions haven't captured data yet
- System Screen Time API limitation

### **Scenario 4: Extension Gets Data But Filters It Out**
```
🚀 TodayOverviewReport.makeConfiguration: EXTENSION INVOKED!
📈 Segment 1: duration=120s
   📂 Category 1
      📱 App 1: app 123456 = 60s
      ⚠️ Filtered out: app 123456
📊 TodayOverviewReport SUMMARY:
   Segments: 1, Categories: 1, Apps: 1
   totalDuration: 0s (after filtering)
```
**Problem**: Data exists but all apps are placeholders
**Fix**: Adjust sanitization logic

## 🔧 ADDITIONAL CHECKS

### **1. Verify Extension in Scheme**
- Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Build tab: SE7ENDeviceActivityReportExtension should be checked
- Run tab: Should be in "Executables"

### **2. Check Signing**
- Select SE7ENDeviceActivityReportExtension target
- Signing & Capabilities tab
- Verify no errors/warnings

### **3. Verify on Device**
Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > Developer App
- SE7EN should show all extensions

### **4. Check Screen Time Permission**
Settings > Screen Time > App & Website Activity
- SE7EN must be listed and ENABLED

## 💡 MOST LIKELY ISSUES

Based on "0 min 0 apps" after 20 minutes:

### **Issue #1: System Not Collecting Data**
The Screen Time API has a known limitation: it doesn't collect usage data for apps that were running BEFORE monitoring started. 

**Solution**: 
1. Force quit ALL apps
2. Restart device
3. Set up monitoring in SE7EN
4. THEN use apps fresh

### **Issue #2: Category-Only Selection**
With 195 apps selected via categories, the system might not be tracking individual app usage correctly.

**Test**: Try selecting 1-2 specific apps manually instead of categories.

### **Issue #3: Extension Not Being Installed**
The "crossed icon" you mentioned suggests the extension might not be installing.

**Fix**:
1. Delete app from device completely
2. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Reset package caches (File > Packages > Reset Package Caches)
4. Rebuild and install
