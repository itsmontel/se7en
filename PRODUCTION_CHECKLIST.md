## 🔴 Critical - Must Complete Before Production

### 1. Screen Time API Integration ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Fully implemented with real Screen Time integration  
**Location:** `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift`, `Services/DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift`, `Services/FamilyActivityService.swift`

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Complete `setupAppMonitoring(for:)` method - implement DeviceActivity monitoring
- [x] Complete `getCurrentUsage(for:)` method - fetch real usage data using DeviceActivityReport
- [x] Implement `DeviceActivityMonitor` extension for real-time monitoring
- [x] Connect real usage data to `AppState.monitoredApps`
- [x] Implement app blocking functionality using `ManagedSettings`
- [x] Implement FamilyActivityPicker integration for app selection
- [x] Add real-time event handling for warnings and limits
- [x] Connect onboarding flow to Screen Time authorization
- [x] Add automatic credit deduction when limits exceeded
- [x] Implement daily and weekly reset logic

**Ready for Testing:**
- Apple Developer account with Family Controls entitlement approval
- Device with Screen Time enabled for testing
- See `SCREEN_TIME_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` for complete details

### 2. Data Persistence ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Status:** Core Data model exists but not fully connected  
**Location:** `Models/CoreData/`

**Required Tasks:**
- [ ] Connect `AppState` to Core Data for persistence
- [ ] Save user preferences (pet selection, username, settings)
- [ ] Save credit history and weekly plans
- [ ] Save monitored apps and their limits
- [ ] Implement data migration strategy
- [ ] Load saved data on app launch
- [ ] Sync data when app returns from background
- [ ] Handle Core Data errors gracefully

### 3. StoreKit Configuration ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Status:** Code complete, needs App Store Connect setup

**Required Tasks:**
- [ ] Create products in App Store Connect:
  - Weekly subscription (auto-renewable)
  - 1 credit (consumable)
  - 3 credits (consumable)
  - 7 credits (consumable)
- [ ] Create StoreKit configuration file (`.storekit`) for testing
- [ ] Test purchase flows in sandbox environment
- [ ] Test subscription renewal
- [ ] Test restore purchases
- [ ] Test refund scenarios
- [ ] Implement receipt validation (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Handle purchase errors and edge cases

**Product IDs** (already defined in code):
- `virtupet_weekly_subscription`
- `virtupet_one_credit`
- `virtupet_three_credits`
- `virtupet_seven_credits`

### 4. Fix Code Issues 🔧
**Location:** `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` line 57

- [ ] Fix: `setupAppMonitoring` method has incomplete code (missing bundleID extraction)

**Current code:**
```swift
private func setupAppMonitoring(for goal: AppGoal) {
    guard let bundleID = goal.appBundleID else { return }
    // Missing implementation
}
```

**Should be:**
```swift
private func setupAppMonitoring(for goal: AppGoal) {
    guard let bundleID = goal.appBundleID else { return }
    
    // Implement actual DeviceActivity monitoring
    // Create DeviceActivitySchedule
    // Set up monitoring intervals
    // Register with DeviceActivityCenter
}
```
