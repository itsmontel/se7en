# Seven - The Credit Accountability App

Seven is a behavior-accountability app that helps users reduce screen addiction and stay disciplined with daily app usage limits using a unique credit-anchored system.

## 🎯 Concept

Users commit to daily goals (e.g., "Use Instagram for no more than 2 hours"). If they stick to the goal, they keep a credit. If they break it, they lose a credit. Each week, users must maintain their 7-credit balance to continue using the app.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **7-Credit System**
- Weekly subscription grants 7 credits
- Daily accountability: keep or lose credits based on app usage
- End-of-week reset requires returning to 7 credits
- Pay only for lost credits ($0.99 per credit)

### 2. **App Usage Monitoring**
- Track daily usage of selected apps
- Real-time progress updates
- Visual indicators for status (on track/warning/over limit)

### 3. **Daily Goal Setting**
- Customizable time limits for each app
- Easy-to-use time picker interface
- Enable/disable monitoring per app

### 4. **Credit History**
- Weekly progress dashboard
- Daily breakdown of credit changes
- Statistics and insights

### 5. **Subscription Management**
- Transparent billing
- Credit top-up store
- Consumable in-app purchases

## 💰 Business Model

### Revenue Streams

### Why It Scales

- Predictable recurring revenue

## 🧠 Psychology

Seven relies on powerful behavioral principles:

- **Loss Aversion**: Users strongly avoid losing credits
- **Score Maintenance**: The number "7" becomes a psychological anchor
- **Gamification**: Credits feel like a streak or health bar
- **Weekly Reset**: Creates constant engagement
- **Investment**: Users stay committed to their progress
