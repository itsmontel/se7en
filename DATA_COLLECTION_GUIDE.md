# Screen Time Data Collection Guide

## 🎯 WHY YOU SEE "0 MINUTES" RIGHT NOW

Your monitoring is **correctly configured** but has **no data yet** because:

1. **Monitoring just started** - You just set up the monitoring sessions
2. **No historical data** - Screen Time API doesn't provide historical data
3. **Real-time collection** - Data is collected as you USE apps, not retroactively
4. **Update intervals** - Monitor events fire every 10 minutes

## 📱 HOW TO GET DATA SHOWING

### **STEP 1: Actually Use Apps (5-10 minutes)**
Close VirtuPet and use other apps for 5-10 minutes:
- Instagram, Safari, YouTube, etc.
- Switch between different apps
- Use them actively (not just open in background)

### **STEP 2: Wait for Monitor Events**
The monitor is configured to fire every 10 minutes:
```
Update threshold: 10 minutes
Monitoring should fire events every 10 minutes
```
Wait at least 10 minutes after using apps.

### **STEP 3: Reopen VirtuPet**
After 10+ minutes of app usage:
1. Close all apps
2. Reopen VirtuPet
3. The DeviceActivityReport will trigger
4. Check console for: `📊 TodayOverviewReport: totalDuration=XXXs`

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE

### **When It's Working:**
```
📊 TodayOverviewReport: totalDuration=600s uniqueApps=5
💾 TodayOverviewReport: Saved summary to shared container (minutes=10, apps=5, top=5)
```

### **If Still Zero:**
```
📊 TodayOverviewReport: totalDuration=0s uniqueApps=0
```
This means NO apps were used or monitoring hasn't fired yet.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

### **Screen Time API Limitations:**
1. **No historical data** - Can't see usage before monitoring started
2. **Real-time only** - Collects data as it happens
3. **Active usage only** - Background app time may not count
4. **Update delays** - 10-minute intervals for updates
5. **Extension timing** - Reports only update when viewed

### **What Your Logs Show:**
```
✅ Authorization: true
✅ Started global monitoring for DeviceActivityReport extensions
✅ Started frequent monitoring for All Categories Tracking
✅ Categories: 13 (all categories selected)
✅ Events configured: update.com.virtupet.allcategories, limit.com.virtupet.allcategories
✅ Monitoring should fire events every 10 minutes
```

**Everything is set up correctly!** You just need actual app usage to generate data.

## 🧪 TESTING PROCEDURE

### **Day 1 (Today):**
1. ✅ Monitoring is now active
2. Use phone normally for rest of day
3. Check VirtuPet periodically (every 30 mins)
4. Look for data appearing

### **Day 2 (Tomorrow):**
- Wake up → Open VirtuPet → Should show "0 minutes" (fresh day)
- Use apps → Wait 10 mins → Reopen VirtuPet → Should show usage
- Throughout day → Data accumulates in real-time

## 🐛 IF STILL NOT WORKING TOMORROW

### **Check Console For:**
1. **Extension not invoked:**
   - No `📊 TodayOverviewReport` logs
   - Extension might not be installed
   - Rebuild and reinstall app

2. **Monitor not firing:**
   - No monitor event logs
   - Check if app is in background restrictions
   - Verify Screen Time permission

3. **Authorization issues:**
   - `Authorization status: false`
   - Go to Settings > Screen Time > App & Website Activity
   - Ensure VirtuPet is enabled

## 💡 WHY YOUR PHONE'S SCREEN TIME SHOWS 3+ HOURS

The system's Screen Time is tracking usage **before you installed VirtuPet**. Your app can only see data **from the moment monitoring started** (which was just now in your logs).

This is a fundamental limitation of the Screen Time API - **no retroactive data access**.

## 🎯 EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Right now**: 0 minutes (no data yet)
- **After 10 mins of app use**: First monitor event fires
- **After reopening VirtuPet**: Report extension processes data
- **After 30+ mins of varied app use**: Meaningful data appears

Be patient - the system needs real usage data to report!
